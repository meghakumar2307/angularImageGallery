Task: Image Gallery with Tags

Description:
Create an image gallery application using Angular/React as a Frontend, PHP and MySQL as a Backend. The task involves building a dynamic image gallery with the ability to assign and filter images based on tags.

1. Image Upload:
	a. Create a form to allow users to upload images.
	b. Implement server-side validation to ensure only image files are uploaded.
	c. Store the uploaded images on the server and save their file paths in the database.
2. Image Gallery:
	a. Display the uploaded images in a gallery format, showing thumbnails of each image.
	b. Implement pagination to handle a large number of images efficiently.
3. Image Tagging:
	a. Allow users to assign tags to each image during or after the upload process.
	b. Implement an input field where users can enter tags separated by commas.
	c. Store the tags in a separate database table, associating them with the corresponding images.
4. Tag Filtering:
	a. Display a list of available tags above or beside the image gallery.
	b. Allow users to click on a tag to filter the images and show only those associated with the selected tag.
	c. Use Angular Service to perform dynamic filtering without reloading the entire page.
5. Image Details:
	a. When a user clicks on an image in the gallery, display a modal or a separate page with more information about the image.
	b. Show the image in a larger size along with its associated tags and any additional details you choose to include.
6. Image Search:
	a. Implement a search feature that allows users to search for images based on their tags or other attributes.
	b. Display the search results dynamically as user types.

Note: In the given time limit, focus on implementing the core functionality of the image gallery, image uploading, tagging, filtering, and basic search. You can simplify the user interface or limit the number of features as needed to fit within the time constraint.
